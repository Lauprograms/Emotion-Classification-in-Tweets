# Emotion-Classification-in-Tweets
Trained a classifier to automatically detect emotions in short English texts, using a labelled dataset of English Twitter messages, where each tweet is labelled with one of six basic emotions :  Anger (0), Fear (1), Joy (2), Love (3), Sadness (4), and Surprise (5).

To run the code efficiently, you want to use Google Colabs, and then you need to click run all for the code to work properly.

Disclaimer : The stage of running the hyperparameters (Step 5) takes an average of 10 minutes to run.
